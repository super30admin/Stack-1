# Three line explanation of solution in plain english
# I traverse through the array twice and put each element index in a stack once. If current element is greater than the top element in the stack then this is the result 
# for the element at the stack top index. I do this for all the elements. The result for rest of the elements is -1

class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElements(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        length = len(nums)
        stack = []
        result = [-1 for x in range(length)]
        for i in range(2*length): # 0 1 2 3 4 5
            while len(stack) > 0 and nums[i%length] > nums[stack[-1]]:
                idx = stack.pop()
                result[idx] = nums[i%length]
                
            if i < length:
                stack.append(i)
