//Time Complexity:O(N)
//Space Complexity:O(N)
//Approach- First I'll fill up the result array with -1 since the given array is a circular array and I should return -1 to those elements for which I don't encounter any elements greater than that. Otherwise I would be running a loop twice the size of the given array, take modulus of each index to the size of the array and check is that element is greater than the current element at the top of the stack. In this case, I'll pop that index and add the current index value to this index.
